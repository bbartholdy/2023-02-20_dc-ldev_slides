## Why R Markdown?

R Markdown allows you to **seamlessly combine executable R code, its output, and text** in a single document. 

These documents **can be converted to multiple static and dynamic output formats**, including PDF (.pdf), Word (.docx), and HTML (.html).

The benefit of a well-prepared R Markdown document is **full reproducibility**.

A fuzzy monster lawyer in a polka-dot tie stands proudly saying “Nothing further!” The judge (also a cute fuzzy monster) is smiling with their hands raised in celebration of reproducible work."/>

## Why R Markdown?

Full reproducibility also means that, if you  
are able to add more data to your analysis, you will be able to recompile
the report without making any changes in the actual document.

And if you make a mistake...

## R Markdown Exercises

---
class: center, middle

## Exercise 1

`r emo::ji("clock")` **4 mins**

Play around with the different options in the chunk with the code for the table,
and re-Knit to see what each option does to the output.

What happens if you use `eval=FALSE` and `echo=FALSE`? 

What is the difference between this and `include=FALSE`?

`r countdown::countdown(minutes = 4, color_running_background  = "lightgreen", color_running_text = "black", color_finished_background = "red", color_finished_text =  "grey30")`

---
class: center, middle, inverse

## Exercise 1: Solution

Create a chunk with `eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE`

then create another chunk with `include=FALSE` to compare. 

`eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE` will neither run the code in the chunk, nor show the
code in the knitted document. The code chunk essentially doesn’t exist in the
knitted document...

--

...whereas `include=FALSE` will run the code and store the output for later use.

See a comprehensive list of chunk options [here](https://yihui.org/knitr/options/)

## Data Visualisation

class: center, middle

## Why ggplot2?

...because these are 'base' plots

.pull-left[
```{r base-pl-1}
plot(number_items ~ no_membrs, 
     interviews_plotting, 
     col = "blue")
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r base-pl-2}
boxplot(rooms ~ village, 
        interviews_plotting, 
        col = c("blue", "green", "red"))
```
]

---
class: center, middle

...and these are ggplots `r emo::ji("sunglasses")`

.pull-left[
```{r ggplot-1}
interviews_plotting %>% 
   ggplot(aes(x = no_membrs, y = number_items, color = village)) +
      geom_count() +
      theme_bw() +
      labs(x = "Number of items", 
           y = "Number of members in a household")
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r ggplot-2}
interviews_plotting %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = village, y = rooms, fill = village)) +
    geom_boxplot() +
    theme_minimal() +
    theme(legend.position = "none",
        panel.grid.major.x = element_blank())
```

## ggplot2

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/master/pkgdown/favicon/apple-touch-icon-120x120.png)

[**ggplot2**](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) is a package (included in **tidyverse**) for creating highly customisable plots that are built
step-by-step by adding layers.

The separation of a plot into layers allows a high degree of flexibility with
minimal effort.

```r
<DATA> %>%
    ggplot(aes(<MAPPINGS>)) +
    <GEOM_FUNCTION>() +
    <CUSTOMISATION>
```

## Data Visualisation Exercises

---
class: center, middle

## Exercise 2

`r emo::ji("clock")` **6 mins**

Create a new code chunk with the label `rooms-village-scatter`.

Create a scatter plot of `rooms` by `village` with the `respondant_wall_type`
showing in different colours. 

Does this seem like a good way to display the relationship between these variables?

What other kinds of plots might you use to show this type of data?

`r countdown::countdown(minutes = 6, color_running_background  = "lightgreen", color_running_text = "black", color_finished_background = "red", color_finished_text =  "grey30")`

---
class: middle, inverse

## Exercise 2: Solution

```{r exercise-2-setup, echo=FALSE}
percent_wall_type <- interviews_plotting %>%
    filter(respondent_wall_type != "cement") %>%
    count(village, respondent_wall_type) %>%
    group_by(village) %>%
    mutate(percent = (n / sum(n)) * 100) %>%
    ungroup()
```


<pre>
&#96;&#96;&#96;{r rooms-village-scatter}
percent_wall_type %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = village, y = percent, fill = respondent_wall_type)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
    theme_classic() +
    scale_fill_viridis_d() # add colourblind-friendly palette
&#96;&#96;&#96;
</pre>

```{r exercise-2-sol, echo=FALSE, fig.width=9, fig.height=3.5, fig.retina=3}
percent_wall_type %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = village, y = percent, fill = respondent_wall_type)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
    theme_classic() +
    scale_fill_viridis_d() # add colourblind-friendly palette
```

class: center, middle

## Captioning

Now that we have created the plot, we can also create a caption.

e.g. 

<pre>
&#96;&#96;&#96;{r rooms-village-scatter, fig.cap="This plot shows the relationship between the variables room and village,
but doesn't do a very good job at it."}
percent_wall_type %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = village, y = percent, fill = respondent_wall_type)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
    theme_classic() +
    scale_fill_viridis_d() # add colourblind-friendly palette
&#96;&#96;&#96;
</pre>

## Exercise 3

`r emo::ji("clock")` **4 mins**

Boxplots are useful summaries, but hide the shape of the distribution. For example,
if the distribution is bimodal, we would not see it in a boxplot.

Replace the box plot with a violin plot  
see `geom_violin()`

`r countdown::countdown(minutes = 5, color_running_background  = "lightgreen", color_running_text = "black", color_finished_background = "red", color_finished_text =  "grey30")`

---

## Exercise 3: Solution

```{r exercise-3-sol, fig.width=9, fig.height=3.5, fig.retina=3}
interviews_plotting %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = respondent_wall_type, y = rooms)) +
  geom_violin() +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.5, color = "tomato")
```

---
class: center, middle

## Exercise 4

`r emo::ji("clock")` **8 mins**

Create a bar plot showing the proportion of respondents in each village who are 
or are not part of an irrigation association (`memb_assoc`). 

Include only respondents who answered that question in the calculations and plot.

Which village had the lowest proportion of respondents in an irrigation association?

`r countdown::countdown(minutes = 10, color_running_background  = "lightgreen", color_running_text = "black", color_finished_background = "red", color_finished_text =  "grey30")`

--

### Hint

```{r exercise-4-hint}
percent_memb_assoc <- interviews_plotting %>%
  filter(!is.na(memb_assoc)) %>%
  count(village, memb_assoc) %>%
  group_by(village) %>%
  mutate(percent = (n / sum(n)) * 100) %>%
  ungroup()
```

---
class: center, middle, inverse

## Exercise 4: Solution

```{r exercise-4-sol, fig.width=7, fig.height=2.5, fig.retina=3}
percent_memb_assoc <- interviews_plotting %>%
  filter(!is.na(memb_assoc)) %>%
  count(village, memb_assoc) %>%
  group_by(village) %>%
  mutate(percent = (n / sum(n)) * 100) %>%
  ungroup()

percent_memb_assoc %>%
   ggplot(aes(x = village, y = percent, fill = memb_assoc)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge")
```

---
class: center, middle

## Exercise 5

`r emo::ji("clock")` **4 mins**

Experiment with at least two different themes. Build the previous plot using each
of those themes. 

Which do you like best?

`r countdown::countdown(minutes = 5, color_running_background  = "lightgreen", color_running_text = "black", color_finished_background = "red", color_finished_text =  "grey30")`

--

### Hint

.pull-left[
`theme_minimal`  
`theme_void`  
`theme_classic`  
]
.pull-right[
`theme_dark`  
`theme_grey`  
`theme_light`
]

## Exercise 5: Solution

```{r exercise-5-sol, eval=TRUE}
percent_items %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = village, y = percent)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
    facet_wrap(~ items) +
    theme_bw() + #<<
    theme(panel.grid = element_blank())
```

percent_items %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = village, y = percent)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
    facet_wrap(~ items) +
    theme_bw() + #<<
